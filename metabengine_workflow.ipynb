    "\n",
    "* ```metabengine``` aims to provide tools for the accurate and reproducible metabolomics data processing. Informed by ion identity, ```metabengine``` groups millions of ions in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data for generating a list of unique chemical species.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Artificial neural network (ANN) is employed in ```metabengine``` to automatically interpret chromatographic peak shapes, labeling the high-quality features with Gaussian-shaped peak for reliable quantitative analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```metabengine``` also labels isotope, adducts, and in-source fragments based on peak-peak correlation and tandem MS/MS spectra (if available)."
